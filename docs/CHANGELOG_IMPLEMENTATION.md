# Velora — Implementation History & Work Log

## Purpose

This file is the living record of the important work already performed and the engineering work that should be performed next.

## Already Implemented / Observed

### Architecture

- Multi-tenant Laravel SaaS architecture exists.
- Domain-oriented booking services/DTOs/events/exceptions exist.
- Tenant routing uses Stancl Tenancy middleware.
- Tenant-aware cache/filesystem/queue bootstrapping is configured.

### Booking

- Public booking page exists.
- Service/staff availability endpoints exist.
- Time-slot validation was added and iterated on.
- Staff scheduling/time normalization was improved.
- Booking creation has dedicated domain service logic.
- Appointment events and slot-unavailable exception exist.

### Queue

- Public queue APIs exist.
- Admin queue operations exist.
- Call-next, serve, complete and return-to-waiting flows exist.
- Appointment/queue integration tests exist.

### Administration

- Admin dashboard exists.
- Appointments, customers, staff, reports and settings areas exist.
- Admin onboarding exists.
- Profile management exists.
- Assistant management exists.

### Subscription / Billing

- Subscription dashboard restructuring was performed.
- Duplicate subscription-dashboard controller responsibility was reduced.
- Subscription usage information exists.
- Stripe customer/price data is supported.
- Trial extension flow exists.
- Billing portal/checkout routes exist.
- Moyasar routes/callback exist.
- Trial/grace/expired subscription enforcement exists.
- Founder trial alerts exist.

### Settings / Localization

- Settings structure was rebuilt and split into partial views.
- Arabic business name support was added to the rendered settings form.
- Multiple tenant languages are supported by the locale layer.

### Testing

- Feature tests cover booking, appointments, queue, billing, localization and other administration areas.
- Dedicated test base classes exist for tenant and super-admin scenarios.

## Important Risks Identified

### P0

1. Tenant isolation must be verified for every explicit central/tenant database access.
2. Payment-provider webhooks must be the source of truth and must be idempotent.
3. Object-level authorization must be verified for all ID-based resources.

### P1

4. Storage quota currently needs real usage tracking.
5. Billing history should be evaluated against formal invoice requirements.
6. Public endpoints need explicit abuse/rate-limit verification.
7. Subscription state transitions should be decoupled from normal requests where possible.
8. Database indexes/performance should be reviewed under realistic tenant volume.

### P2

9. Dashboard analytics should be refactored and optimized further.
10. Remaining hard-coded translations should be localized.
11. Production operations/documentation should be completed.
12. Browser/mobile/RTL visual QA should be completed.

## Execution Rule

Every completed task should update this file with:

- Date.
- Scope.
- Files/areas changed.
- Tests run.
- Result.
- Any follow-up risk.
